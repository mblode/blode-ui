Blode UI is a [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com)-based component registry.

A set of beautifully designed components that you can customize, extend, and build on. Start here, then make it your own.

Open Source. Open Code.

This is not a product. It is an opinionated UI registry built by [Matthew Blode](https://matthewblode.com), with a focus on good taste, care, and craft.

## Quick Start

For a new project:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest create
```

For an existing project:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

Add the Blode registry and install your first component:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest registry add @blode=https://ui.blode.co/r/{name}.json
npx shadcn@latest add @blode/button
```

See the full guide at [Installation](/docs/installation).

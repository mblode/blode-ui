<Steps>

### Create project

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

### Configure components.json

You will be asked a few questions to configure `components.json`:

```txt showLineNumbers
Which style would you like to use? › New York
Which color would you like to use as base color? › Zinc
Do you want to use CSS variables for colors? › no / yes
```

### Add the Blode registry

```bash
npx shadcn@latest registry add @blode=https://ui.blode.co/r/{name}.json
```

### That's it

You can now start adding components to your project.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @blode/button
```

The command above will add the `Button` component to your project. You can then import it like this:

```tsx {1,6} showLineNumbers
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button>Click me</Button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

</Steps>
